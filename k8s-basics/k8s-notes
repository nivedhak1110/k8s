install minikube-darwin-arm64  /Users/karthikey.dhandapani/bin/minikube  -- install binary in the destined path

echo $PATH -- make minikube accessible everywhere ( like env var)
vi ~/.bash_profile PATH=$PATH:/Users/karthikey.dhandapani/bin 
source ~/.bash_profile -- reflect changes 
minikube start -- create cluster
